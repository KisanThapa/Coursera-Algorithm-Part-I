 * Euclidâ€™s algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers
 * <p>
 * Solution:
 * Compute the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers p and q as follows:
 * If q is 0, the answer is p. If not, divide p by q and take the remainder r.
 * The answer is the greatest common divisor of q and r.
